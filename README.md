# Chrome.Docs
Draft documentation for developer features in the Chrome beta, canary, and dev channels.

This repo contains drafts for content that will be moved to MDN when particular versions of Chrome reach stable. Consequently, It's organized with separate directories correspoonding to certain lables on [chromestatus.com](https://www.chromestatus.com/). The current directories are:

- **[M47 beta](m47/)** - Items tentatively scheduled for release in Chrome 47.
  **November 23** - M47 content is in the process of being moved to MDN. DO NOT EDIT.
- **[M48 canary](m48/)** - Items tentatively scheduled for release in Chrome 48.
- **[backlog](backlog/)** - Items that were previously slated for a Chrome release but have been deprioritized. This folder is not intended to correspond to the statuses 'No active development', 'Proposed', or 'In development' on the dashboard. This is simply a place to dump drafts that have been deprioritized.
