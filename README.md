# Chrome.Docs
Temporary documentation for developer features in the Chrome beta, canary, and dev channels.

This repo contains drafts for content that will be moved to MDN when particular versions of Chrome reach stable. Consequently, It's organized with separate directories correspoonding to certain lables on [chromestatus.com](https://www.chromestatus.com/). The current directories are:

- **[M47 dev/canary](m47/)** - Items tentatively scheduled for release in Chrome 47.
- **[backlog](backlog/)** - Items that were previously slated for a Chrome release but have been deprioritized. This folder is not intended to correspond to the statuses 'No active development', 'Proposed', or 'In development' on the dashboard. This is simply a place to dump drafts that have been deprioritized.
