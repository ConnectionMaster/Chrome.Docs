# EncryptedMediaExtensions API

[MDN documentation is already available](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Encrypted_Media_Extensions_API) for this feature.

**Note:** This link is for the unprefixed version of the API, [released in Chrome 42 and 43](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6578378068983808). The change in Chrome 47 is to disable the prefixed API. The prefixed version appears never to have been documented on the Mozilla Developer Network.
