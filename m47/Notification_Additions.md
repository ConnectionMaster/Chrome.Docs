# Notification.Notification()

The following additions will be made to the [appropriate MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/notification/Notification):

## Options

`requireInteraction`: Indicates that on devices with sufficiently large screens, a notification should remain active until the user clicks or dismisses it. If this value is absent or false, the desktop version of Chrome will auto-minimize notifications after approximately eight seconds. The default value is `false`.
